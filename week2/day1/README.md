# Testing, testing, 1, 2, 3?

We started off the day taking our dastardly `Enumerable` methods and breaking them down into `.each` blocks.

You can view the results in a [gist](https://gist.github.com/dummied/0c4a3ae8b92575f1ef78#file-enumerables-rb).

Along the way, we also started talking about tests and testing in Ruby.

## Why we test

Ruby is a dynamic scripting language, rather than a language that passes through a compiler (a compiler is a program that changes our code into something we can think of as static or fixed).
