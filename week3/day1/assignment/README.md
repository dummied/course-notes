## Description

This morning, we talked a bit about git and we just finished off [Blackjack](https://github.com/tiy-indianapolis-ror-june2015/blackjack).

So, today we're going to make blackjack better and learn about git at the same time.

## Deliverables

* A merged pull request on a GitHub repo containing your blackjack game
* A returned index card

## Directions

* First, make a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) repository of your existing blackjack implementation.
* Each of you received an index card with a classmate's name on it. Fork _their_ repo of the blackjack game.
* Create a new branch and make their game _better_. This can mean code comments, entirely new features, new methods. It's up to you.
* Keep your commits small.
* When you're done, push your branch to your fork.
* Make a pull request to the original repo.
* Have said repo accepted.

## More things

There is no "hard" or "nightmare" mode to this one.

However, I can give you some additional learning materials on git:

* http://samkap.github.io/command-line-starter-kit/ - An Iron Yard Austin production walking through commong command line and git commands.

* https://guides.github.com/ - Loads of guides about different aspects of Git and GitHub.
